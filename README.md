# Star Wars Platform ✨

Hi 👋 Jiro Jasmin here.  
This project is a movie wiki platform where users can create a profile and leave their comment on their favorite Star Wars movie 🎬  
This project was implemented with Strapi, the headless CMS, and is the result of the series of [video tutorials published on Strapi official Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnuvFyJE6dg&list=PL7Q0DQYATmvjXSuHfB8CY_n_oUeqZzauZ).
This repository is the UI (which is connected with my Strapi API by data fetching).
